# PHYS381 Final Project — Blood Flow Simulation in Arteries

This project simulates how blood flows through an artery using Poiseuille’s Law. It models how changes in artery radius such as narrowing from plaque buildup—affect the flow rate of blood. The goal is to visualize the impact of arterial constriction and apply fluid dynamics to a biomedical context using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Summary of Cloned Physics Repo

I cloned [computational-physics-python](https://github.com/konstgav/computational-physics-python), which contains Jupyter notebooks that simulate various physical systems. I explored the `wave_equation.ipynb` notebook, which numerically solves the 1D wave equation using finite differences. It demonstrates how waves propagate over time along a string fixed at both ends.
